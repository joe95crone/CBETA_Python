# CBETA_Python
The code created for the Degauss function used on CBETA.

The code uses PyEPICS which feeds to IOCs which enacts the operation specified by the code.

This code is used to degauss all electromagnets (the splitter/recombiner magnets) in CBETA. It links with some already wrote code for the CBETA control system which isn't shown here.
